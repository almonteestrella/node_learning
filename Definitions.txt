In Express.js, you can get the ID of a specific resource in a request by accessing the parameters of the request object. The ID can be defined in the URL of the request as a parameter, which can be accessed in the route handler function.

Here is an example of how to get the ID of a resource using Express.js:

// Define a route with a parameter named "id"
app.get('/resource/:id', function(req, res) {
  // Get the ID from the request parameters
  const id = req.params.id;
  // Use the ID to fetch the resource from a database or other data source
  const resource = getResourceById(id);
  // Return the resource as a JSON response
  res.json(resource);
});

In this example, the req.params.id property is used to get the ID from the URL parameter. This value can then be used to fetch the resource from a database or other data source and return it as a JSON response.

Note that the parameter name in the route definition (i.e. :id) must match the parameter name used in the route handler function (i.e. req.params.id).

STATIC FILES
In Express, you can serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, by using the built-in middleware express.static. This middleware function takes one argument, which is the root directory of the files to be served. Also, this are assects express doesn't have to change.


APP.USE: In Express, app.use() is a method used to mount middleware functions at a specified path. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.

The app.use() method takes a middleware function as an argument, and can also take a path as a string or a regular expression. The path argument is optional, and if not provided, the middleware function will be executed for every incoming request.
